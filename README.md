Link to the project [Zookeeper](https://hyperskill.org/projects/98).

## Stages:
### :white_check_mark:Stage 1/4: Rush into print
Collect data and check if users were attentive in school.
### :white_check_mark:Stage 2/4: Show me an animal!
Perform the first calculations and check if users know how to handle zero.
### :white_check_mark:Stage 3/4: What's inside?
Sometimes the numbers are so big that you have to store them. Implement this feature!
### :white_check_mark:Stage 4/4: Sustainable care <3
Now, it is time to tell users what the calculator thinks about equations.
